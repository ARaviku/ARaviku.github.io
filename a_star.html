        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Hello! I'm Anurekha Ravikumar, a robotics enthusiast with a passion for autonomous systems, perception, and computer vision. I'm a second-year graduate student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, specializing in Mobile Robotics, Computer Vision, Robot Algorithms, and Machine Learning.

        <p>I recently worked as a Robotics Perception Intern at RoboTire, focusing on wheel offset and wheel pick-and-place projects using advanced cameras and ML algorithmsâ€”truly engaging and exciting work! At the University of Michigan, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Distributed Aerospace Systems and Control Laboratory under the guidance of Dr. Dimitra Panagou. There, I developed real-time VIO systems for quadrotors and integrated cutting-edge SLAM technologies.
          
            Currently, I am the Graduate Student Instructor for the Computer Vision course (EECS 504), where I thoroughly enjoy teaching and discussing my favorite subject.</p>
          
        <p>Before delving into robotics, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering from Stony Brook University, NY. Subsequently, I worked at JnJ's DePuy Synthes (Orthopedic Implant Industry) as a Mechanical Engineer and Post-Market Surveillance Engineer for about 2.5 years, before redirecting my focus to robotics.</p>
