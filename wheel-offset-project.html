        In the Wheel Offset Project, I accurately measured variations in wheel mating surfaces during the transition from summer to winter tires. Leveraging point cloud data from the OakD-SR stereo camera, an advanced YOLO model, and other point cloud filtering algorithms, I identified the exact locations of the wheel center, lug holes, and mating surfaces. Utilizing RANSAC and other point cloud algorithms, I precisely detected the mating plane of the wheel, significantly enhancing the tire swapping process with millimeter-level precision.</p>
