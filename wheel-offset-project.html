        In the Wheel Offset Project, I accurately measured variations in wheel mating surfaces during the transition from summer to winter tires. Leveraging point cloud data from the OakD-SR stereo camera, an advanced YOLO model, and other point cloud filtering algorithms, I identified the exact locations of the wheel center, lug holes, and mating surfaces. Utilizing RANSAC and other point cloud algorithms, I precisely detected the mating plane of the wheel, significantly enhancing the tire swapping process with millimeter-level precision.

        The successful completion of the wheel offset project served as a proof of concept, leading to this next
        endeavor. The existing system at RoboTire utilized Zivid cameras, which cost around $12,000, and were
        known for their excellent point cloud capabilities and off-the-shelf functionalities for completing the
        sequences of tire changing in cars. During my internship, I was able to replace one of their vital
        functions—picking the wheel from the floor and placing it precisely on the hub—all with sub-millimeter
        level precision. This was achieved utilizing the OakD-SR camera, which costs about $300. This engaging
        and fun project saw me leveraging the YOLO model, point cloud data, OpenCV, Open3D, mathematical
        geometries, and numpy to reach the desired results.</p>

        I also worked on YOLO segmentation to extract the accurate shape of the lug nut, rather than just using a bounding box, which opens up new applications at RoboTire.
